# Atlas Terminal - Pitch Deck Content

---

## Slide 1: Title

# ATLAS TERMINAL

## The institutional terminal for on-chain wealth management

Transform fragmented on-chain data into actionable investment intelligence.

An AI-powered portfolio and settlement engine for the tokenized economy.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

# THE PROBLEM

## Institutions are flying blind on-chain

Institutional investors are allocating capital on-chain, but the tooling is not built for them.

**Key problems:**
- No unified view across chains and protocols
- Manual allocation decisions with delayed insights
- Settlement inefficiencies reducing capital efficiency
- Compliance and audit blind spots
- Too much data, not enough intelligence

**Today's reality:**

A CIO managing $500M across Ethereum, Solana, and L2 protocols must:
- Log into 15+ dashboards
- Manually track yields and risks
- Miss reallocation opportunities
- Struggle to produce audit-ready reports

Legacy terminals were not designed for on-chain finance.

## Slide 3: Use Case

# USE CASE

## How institutions actually use Atlas

**Step 1: Morning portfolio review**
- One dashboard showing exposure across all chains
- Idle capital and settlement delays highlighted automatically

**Step 2: Actionable insight**
- Atlas flags underperforming allocations
- AI recommends reallocating capital into higher-yield tokenized treasuries

**Step 3: Risk and compliance check**
- Constraints validated in real time
- Concentration and counterparty risk approved automatically

**Step 4: Execution**
- Capital redeployed with T+0 settlement
- Full audit trail generated instantly

**Result:** faster decisions, higher capital utilization, lower operational risk.

## Slide 4: Market

# MARKET

## Institutional wealth is moving on-chain

**What is changing:**
- Tokenized treasuries and funds are live
- Banks and asset managers are entering production
- Regulatory clarity is improving globally

**Market signals:**
- BlackRock BUIDL reaching multi-billion AUM
- JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton launching tokenized products
- Real-world assets moving on-chain at accelerating speed

**Market size:**
- Global AUM: **~$220T**
- Tokenized by 2030: **~$16T**
- Revenue opportunity: **$10B+** (software and data)

---

## Slide 5: Timing

# TIMING

## A short window of opportunity

**Infrastructure is ready**
- Ethereum L2s and Solana support institutional scale
- Tokenized treasuries prove real demand

**Institutions are allocating**
- Family offices, banks, and asset managers are active
- Capital is moving before tooling catches up

**Legacy vendors are slow**
- Bloomberg, Refinitiv, and FactSet lack native on-chain portfolio intelligence
- 18 to 24 month gap before incumbents adapt

**Value has moved up the stack**
- Raw data is commoditized
- Decision intelligence commands a premium

---

## Slide 6: Solution
